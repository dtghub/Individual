Initialise board
LOOP;
    display board
    user input moves - no move validation in the mvp
    execute input moves by updating board


white is lowercase; so white pawn is p, black pawn in P, etc

    Just load a set of values into a 2 dimensional array (the 'board')




display board
    Iterate over the board array and print it out
    decorate with 'a' 'b' 'c', '1' '2' '3' around the board



user input moves - no move validation in the mvp
    Input coordinate to move from 
        basic check that there is actually a piece there
    Input coordinate to move to (destination)

    Piece is copied to the destination square - if theer is a piece there it is overwritten by the new piece
    Square moved from is replaced with a blank character (space?)
